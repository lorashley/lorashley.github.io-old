Packing for my first trip to Asia was a somewhat new experience for me, a lifelong overpacker. The first thing I did in preparation was get a hiking backpack that would be suitiable for travel. To be honest, I probably wanted to pretend that I was backpacking through asia. We're not staying in any hostels, but we are visiting about 4 different airbnbs and taking 3 flights within Asia in addition to the 40 hour round trip dedication to get there. It's a lot of movement, I think a backpack will definitely help my general hot mess self.

My bags:

- 1 x REI 40L TrailPack
- 1 x Fjallraven Kanken 2 backpack
- 1 x roll-up-able crossbody bag
- 2 x fold-up-tiny reusable bags (like you go to market with)

Carrying so many bags might not seem quite minimalist but each bag has extra room in it, not to heavy, and serves a unique function.

The 40L bag carries all of my clothes, sneakers, most of my toiletries and non-essentials. This can get checked in at JFK and I will not see it until we arrive in Bangkok. We'll see if I take it in cabin.

The Fjallraven will accompany me to my seat and contains my bose headphones, leggings and an ultra light sweater, cashews (healthy snack), my minimal makeup back, and my iPad. This also has the cross body bag within it and the reusable bags. During the trip, this will be my day bag for any nature adventures.

The crossbody bag is smaller, yet still spacious. It is my go-to city travel bag, because it has a large zip and magnetic clasp - it feels very secure. I also don't mind if it gets dirty, and it is very easy to throw on and go. I would only keep the essentials in this bag.

Finally, my 2 reusable bags will be for markets and shopping. I'm not sure what the plastic situation in the markets of Thailand are like, but I want to try to remain conscious of my plastic consumption.

My clothes:

- 3 x tank tops (cropped: white, black, white/black stripe, tan/black print)
- 1 x jeans (neutral blue, subtle floral print)
- 1 x shorts (black, high-waist)
- 1 x skirt (white, short)
- 2 x dress (floral, bright long & pastel short)
- 1 x leggings (long black)
- 1 x athletic shorts (for exercise and sleep)
- 3 x bathing suits
- 1 x sarong (light, floral)

Flying outfit:

- 1 x tank top (black)
- 1 x cover up (turquoise/tan)
- 1 x light sweater (tan)
- 1 x leggings (long tan)
- 1 x maxi skirt (neutral brown)

Shoes:
- 1 x flip flops (sexy crocs)
- 1 x sneakers (everday asics)

Between all of these clothes (note: i brought a variety of underwear/bras too),
I estimated over 25 outfit combinations, I stopped counting. I chose basics for tops;
each top can be paired with every bottom option, and the non-print tanks can go on the dresses as well. The sarong can work as a skirt or scarf, adding variety to each.
Honestly, I'll see how this goes, but from a packing perspective (and honestly for capsule closet goals) - I'm not sure why I haven't done this sooner.
