Packing for my first trip to Asia was a somewhat new experience for me, a lifelong overpacker. The first thing I did in preparation was get a hiking backpack that would be suitiable for travel. To be honest, I probably wanted to pretend that I was backpacking through asia. We're not staying in any hostels, but we are visiting about 4 different airbnbs and taking 3 flights within Asia in addition to the 40 hour round trip dedication to get there. It's a lot of movement, I think a backpack will definitely help my general hot mess self.

My bags:

- 1 x REI 40L TrailPack
- 1 x Fjallraven Kanken 2 backpack
- 1 x roll-up-able crossbody bag
- 2 x fold-up-tiny reusable bags (like you go to market with)

The 40L bag carries all of my clothes, sneakers, most of my toiletries and non-essentials. This can get checked in at JFK and I will not see it until we arrive in Bangkok. We'll see if I take it in cabin.

The Fjallraven will accompany me to my seat and contains my bose headphones, leggings and an ultra light sweater, cashews (healthy snack), my minimal makeup back, and my iPad.
