Today will mark my first day of going back to school. 

After some introspection and learning about UX (User Experience), I decided to enroll into
an [Interactive Design Certificate](https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/program/graduate-certificate-in-interactive-design-228/)
program. The great part of this, is that if I really enjoy it as much as I think I will, I
can roll *all* of the credits over into the Masters in Digital Media. Choosing the program
was somewhat tough, I was torn between two. I chose the program that was more creative, the
other involved more user research and a business-oriented focus. I have never studied in a
creative field, so it felt like a necessary step.

I'm extremely excited, but my rather new, small insta account is going to hopefully get
*really vulnerable*. I'm going to be working on stuff and it's going to look like shit or
like beautiful shit. 

Regardless: 

I'm going to share it. <br>
I'm going to be self-conscious. <br>
I'm going to regret posting it.<br>
I'm going to want to make it perfect.<br>
I'm going to show my work. <br>


**UPDATE**

I did one class, got a new position at my company, and it became hard to manage both.
It was a really great experience, so I'll share my works. I'd like to take more classes,
but maybe in a different program that does require so much classroom commitment.

#### Final
For our final, we had to create a peice of work in the style of another artist. I chose a graphic designer [Loish](https://www.instagram.com/loisvb) to base my work on and the beautiful actress Hannah Simone to portray. I decided to grab a $100 Wacom Tablet and try it out!

![Esquire Photoshoot](https://hips.hearstapps.com/esq.h-cdn.co/assets/cm/15/07/54daeaef7609b_-_esq-10-hannah-simone-mimp-xln.jpg?resize=980:*)

I first started with paper sketches of a different photo before realizing I should do it all digitally. It did help me to understand the spacial sense of a body, better than I had before. I also followed Loish's [Tutorials](https://loish.deviantart.com/art/tutorial-drawing-a-female-face-517588691) when practicing and trying to draw in her style and with greater proportion skills.

![Final in progress - Outline](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/iNA7M_o4hUdjX3FoZHlGBrMGEi88rJ0HvXzOCVbL5GATJ5Rn2ULl_3FctnXEBcQNkYMWadSYPWzUBQiicA9khqvgaL7M-O5dTpWi48Xm2dhfvJDimGBWobOuV0mdg1-lRgTQmPoZY2Q=w2400)

Loish features strong women characters in her work and is known for portraying all shapes and sizes. They have a whimsicle feel to them and she usually picks a color scheme and sticks to the highlights and contours being in that scheme (not necessarily realistic). I chose pink and blue as my highlight and contour colors. I attempted to make her body slightly more plush than the photo, and I gave her hair cartoon-ish fullness.

Honestly, I was so proud of my work. Even my instructor was highly impressed (for a brand new art student).

I wanted to hold myself accountable and try to create things more often to get better, but it hasn't happened yet. Everytime I start a project (for instance, pet portraits), I feel like it looks like garbage, I get discouraged, and stop. I am sure I'll try it again, but for now let's leave it here haha!
