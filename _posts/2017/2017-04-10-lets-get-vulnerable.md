Today will mark my first day of going back to school. 

After some introspection and learning about UX (User Experience), I decided to enroll into
an [Interactive Design Certificate](https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/program/graduate-certificate-in-interactive-design-228/)
program. The great part of this, is that if I really enjoy it as much as I think I will, I
can roll *all* of the credits over into the Masters in Digital Media. Choosing the program
was somewhat tough, I was torn between two. I choose the program that was more creative, the
other involved more user research and a business-oriented focus. I have never studied in a
creative field, so it felt like a necessary step.

I'm extremely excited, but my rather new, small insta account is going to hopefully get
*really vulnerable*. I'm going to be working on stuff and it's going to look like shit or
like beautiful shit. 

Regardless: 

I'm going to share it. <br>
I'm going to be self-conscious. <br>
I'm going to regret posting it.<br>
I'm going to want to make it perfect.<br>
I'm going to show my work. <br>
