I can’t express how often I feel like an imposter. I can’t explain it either and even reassuring words from colleagues and friends can be a temporary fix, but ultimately can make me feel worse.
Part of me wants to tell myself “just get over it” and maybe I do need to, but the true cure I’ve found is hearing from others about their own stories and relatable struggles that others face.

For my imposters:

Standing up to the hiring process: 

- [Say No To Google Recruiters](http://www.yegor256.com/2017/02/21/say-no-to-google-recruiters.html)


I shared some of these with my social and professional networks and it was really refreshing to see how many people could relate, both men and women, young and old. 

My goal for this post is to find as many articles as I can and create enough material for us to refer to when feeling like a fraud.
The purpose isn’t to make us complacent either. 
Keep learning, define your goals and exceed them. 
When you have a setback, be sure to reflect so you can grow from it.
