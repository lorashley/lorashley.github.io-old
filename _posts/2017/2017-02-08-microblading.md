Microblading was something I've wanted for a while. I researched the process heavily, but there were still surprises in the outcome.
Overall I think I'm extremely happy with it. When I look at the before photo, there is no question. I felt so naked without
brows, and honestly I'm not a makeup person. I hated that I felt **ugly** leaving the house without doing my brows. I don't
feel that way anymore, so I think microblading is worth it. All the photos to follow show no brow makeup.

This is a before and after at the time of my first microblading session.

## The Process
I arrived for my session and my artist worked with my facial structure, current eyebrow shape, and eyebrow desires to draw on eyebrows to my face. 
Once I was happy with them she put on the numbing cream and we waited about 10-15 minutes for it to sink it. She began the tattooing which didn't hurt at first.
I was sure that it was going to be a breeze and **then** I felt the pain. Maybe the numbing cream was wearing off or maybe I was sensitive. Regardless, for me
the pain felt like eyebrow threading. Eyebrow threading is my least favorite thing, I want to cry every time. I could wax my eyebrows for days but back off with
the threads. So, this pain lasted about another 30 minutes and then we were done! I think the whole process was an hour? She has been doing this for over 5 years,
originally she learned in China before moving back to America and microblading was "new" at that time over here.

## Healing (Round One)
Over the next two weeks, the brows heal. **Pigment fades** and they do not look as flawless as when you first got them.
This is why you have touchups. 

Before the peeling I was taking selfies non-stop and basking in my fleekness. I did notice that they seemed dissimilar, but knew this would all be addressed in the touchup.

Here's an unflattering photo showing the peeling. Peeling is normal, you don't pick at it. Just like a tattoo on your body would peel, your brows do too.

Overall, the strokes became less defined (I barely see them now) but the darkness was still there. That's ok for me.
It could be how my skin takes the pigment, not everyone's skin takes it the same. But my brows look **MUCH** better than
before.

My touchup is in a week. I'll post more photos after the touchups.
