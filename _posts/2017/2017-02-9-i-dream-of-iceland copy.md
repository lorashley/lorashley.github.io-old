This may have been one of my favorite trips of all time. <!--more-->While the flights were cheap ($350 for 5 Days in London and 5 days in Iceland),
Iceland was far from it. But it was truly the most magical trip I've taken. Icelandair had a [spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/icelandair/playlist/28eBhAwh4s7NJL8H8PJ5v6) (extra clutch) and for me,
music transports me back to certain places and moments in time. The sounds complimented the Icelandic scenery. Each day felt packed with activity, so lets break it down:

We got in the night before from London, but it was practically midnight before we were settled in our AirB&B. I was sick since our day-trip
to Paris. Honestly, London & Paris was 5 days of no sleep. Fast-forward to January 19th, we woke up at the crack of dawn 
(figuratively, as dawn wasn't until 10AM in Iceland), to go **snorkeling**!

### Snorkeling through Silfra Fissure

This day was probably the coldest I've ever been in my life. The water stays at 35°F year-round. It was about 32°F outside that day.
Honestly, the water wasn't so bad since it was so cold outside. My hands and feet were numb, but wrapped in the suit I waddled and felt like a penguin.
The water was so clear and fresh, coming straight from the glaciers. 
Getting out of the dry-suit, that was an experience on it's own, probably the hardest part.

We celebrated our successful adventure with bread bowls and beer in Reykjavik. 

Exploring Reykjavik and the surrounding areas for day two. It may sound gross but I adored this postcard because it is SO true.
A little Icelandic lesson - the cold and warm water sources are different. The cold water is from the glacial runoff water, it is
extremely clean so don't bother buying drinking water in Iceland. The warm water, comes from the geothermal waters which smell of
the sulfur (rotten eggs!).

We made our way down to the Reykjanes Peninsula. It was windy and beautiful. 
You could see how strong the waves were as they crashed against the island.

We popped into Cafe Loki for a traditional Icelandic meal. It included mashed fish, trout, rye bread, fermented shark (I was sick
so this wasn't as vile as it apparently is), and delicious rye-bread icecream! 

That night we went Aurora hunting. It was a bit cloudy and after a few hours, we saw **nothing**. It was terribly windy but our
tour guide was so charming with his Icelandic tales. After a few hours we called it a night, we were exhuasted.         

### Golden Circle Day Trip
With our next full day ahead we toured the Golden circle, visiting Gulfoss, the geysirs, and the volcanic crater lake Kerið. We planned on doing a hike in 
Hveragerdi, but the weather was not on our side. We still drove through the hot spring town, which we would visit for sure in the summer. 
Little did we know we would end up here again.

### Dining at Apotek

This was my favorite meal of the trip. It was a 7 course meal with Puffin, Minke Whale (not endangered), Plaise, Perch, Lamb Chops, and more. Everything
was delicious and filling.

Before heading to bed that night, I got a notification that someone saw the lights in none other than Hveragerdi. 
Nick and I jumped in our car, nearly 2AM heading to the open roads in search of the lights. 
Only armed with my iPhone camera, we captured the moment. It felt so rewarding to drive out on our own and find them. Also,
much more romantic than being on a bus full of people. We listened to music and watched them dance above us.

### Icelandic Horseback Riding 

On day four we went horseback riding (my first time)! These Icelandic horses are well kept, and if one leaves Iceland it may never return.
The sunrise was short but beautiful. I must say horseback riding didn't feel natural to me, I was a bit worried the entire time.

### Black Lava Caving

After the horseback excursion, we descended into the Black Lava caves, which were really cool though next time I want to visit the ice caves.

### The truly BLUE lagoon
Our final day was spent at the Blue Lagoon. We didn't have the chance to go to any other hot springs while we were in town. 
I'd definitely try more of them if we visited again in the summer! We arrived at 8AM and it was pretty sparse in the huge lagoon,
as the sun began to rise it got crowded. The entire morning it was raining and snowing, but the water was a warm 100°F.

We tried on the naturally occurring complimentary Silica masks and followed them with the algae masks. Honestly, my skin hasn't felt that soft. It felt soft even the following day!
After soaking for about 4 hours we showered up and headed to the airport. We were exhausted, missing our kitties and our beds.
Another trip for the <s>books</s> blog.
