So it all started with my office and closet makeover and me working towards a more minimalist life. Thus far this year, I have been thoughtful in my words, actions, and lifestyle.
I know it's only February, but it feels like its lasting longer than the usual resolution. Every time I accomplish something, it has propelled me to take on the next challenge.

Since I'm impatient, that challenge was my kitchen. <!--more-->

Whenever I fantasize about my dream kitchen, it looks nothing like the kitchen I currently have.

Exhibit A

Don't get me wrong, it could be a LOT worse, but it does throw the vibe of my entire house off. Also, I'm not THAT invested into redo-ing it because we may only be living
here for a few more years.

So when I assessed what was really getting me down, was not that it's cramped and my husband and I can barely be in it at the same time, but really that my countertops are tile
with ugly dark grout in between. Every kitchen I was obsessed with was all light counter tops. So what was I supposed to do with tile? I'm too cheap to put in something better when this isn't even our final home. I have a feeling that over the course of the blog you'll learn
how selectively frugal I am.

Enter [Grout Renew in Bright White](http://www.homedepot.com/p/Custom-Building-Products-Polyblend-381-Bright-White-8-oz-Grout-Renew-Colorant-GCL381HPT/203498062?gclid=CjwKEAiAz4XFBRCW87vj6-28uFMSJAAHeGZb21ZxiM35RBlmgjKGk3zEY5_gZIU_aU19lz0CTpVfVBoCbqXw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) to save me.
The process was simple. I wiped down the counters, took a toothbrush and painted the lines. No biggie, but it makes all the difference to me! I did a few coats so in the photos you'll
see that sometimes you can see the darker grout beneath it. It requires 24 hours to dry and then I'll do additional touchups where needed. I've read mixed reviews regarding it's durability, but only time will tell. I didn't use that much product in doing this, so
if touchups are necessary I don't think it'll bother me that much.

Hope you like!
