To say that I fell in love with my first trip to Barbados would be an understatement. It has almost everything I want in a dream island and definitely should be a stop on your travel map.

After our friend's wedding in Tobago, we made a stop to Barbados. Nick had already visited in his childhood, but it was my first time. I instantly fell in love.

Growing up, I spent most of my time when not in school, in Trinidad with my family. While I have a hard time identifying to a certain type of people, I do identify to the music, culture, and food of Trinidad.
Caribbean culture brings me such joy, and I try to bring every inch of it closer to me when I can.

While I love my time spent in Trinidad, I often have friends who ask about visiting. To be honest, I don't recommend it, unless you are prepared to see the island for what it is. I won't paint Trinidad with a rose tint, it is raw and unfiltered, our beaches aren't even picturesque. It's an island that doesn't rely on tourism, and it shows. I love my memories of Trinidad, but Barbados had all the joys of Trinidad, without the crime and rudeness.

Let's recap and highlight everything that Barbados had going for it in my 2 day visit.
