So, I've wanted to display my IG pics from our travels and with our friends and I decided I wanted to use a branch to hang them all.
Thankfully I got Nick to drive to a woodsy area of our neighborhood and grab me a fallen branch. I really wanted birch, but
I have no idea what we got (assuming maple?) but I liked it regardless.

#### Step ONE: Find a branch
Did't take pictures during the process. Learning that I should be taking pics for everything I do in case I'll need them.
Our branch was like 5 feet long. I didn't intend on doing such a long branch, but it worked out and I'll tell you why! 

#### Step TWO: Print your pics
I didn't get paid to promote this company by any means. But in case you want to recreate something like this, I did want to share
how awesome everything turned out from them. I ordered the <a href="https://www.socialprintstudio.com/minisquares/">minisquares</a>
from <a href="socialprintstudio.com">social print studio</a>. Other common printing places such as Walgreens and CVS only did
3x3 and larger (same for shutterfly). I wanted smaller pics due to how many I was using and 2x2 was perfect.

#### Step THREE: Assemble! 
The items I used were: Branch, Twine, Pics, Mini Clothespins, & Scissors - SO SIMPLE.

My original thought was to do 12 rows of vertical hanging photos (4 on each strand). But with the mini clothespins the 
string wasn't really staying straight so I went with an alternate plan.

I just strung the twine from one end up the branch to the other side,
letting it droop a bit just add the pics! 

I knotted the twine around the branch for the long ones and we had two existing nails in the wall.
Despite those nails not being symmetrical at all - I used them where they were instead of creating new holes in the wall.

It turned out great for what we wanted.

Good thing I had the longer branch to host the display.
But any size branch should work for you!

Voil√†! 

Happy DIYing,
