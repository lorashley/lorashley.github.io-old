One of our favorite things to do is have wine and a cheeseboard as a dinner alternative from time to time.
One of the local restaurants in Worcester does a beautiful spread that we love to recreate.

1. **Have 2-4 types of cheeses.**
I prefer soft ones so we do about 2 soft cheeses (goat & brie for me) and then 2 firm cheeses
(we enjoy a smoked gouda and cheddar).
2. **Add a few types of charcuterie.**
Prosciutto is our favorite and featured on all of our boards. The others we pick based on the selection at the market.
3. **Add fruit for color (and flavor!)**
I think the popping contrast of blueberries and strawberries are my favorite.
4. **Don't forget the toppings!**
Hands down, fig jam makes our board half the time. Honey is also a great touch. For savory, I've seen
mustards do well with meats.
