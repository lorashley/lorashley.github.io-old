I think I have made over a dozen hello world variations over the course of my attempt at blogging. I think it may have to do with never having the right name. I'm not even sure if I have the right name yet. But, I think I'm getting there. Ellis Enchanted is what I call my house, especially on days where the snow just fell.

Although we have been here for two years, I didn't always feel at home just yet here in New England. In the past few weeks, I've fallen more in love with my home with each passing day as we fill it with things that make it feel, well, like home. Welcome, to Ellis Enchanted - my space for creativity and for those who need a little help finding their home.

xoxo,
L

P.S. If you see posts prior to this one, its me migrating posts I've had at other locations to here! They were posted for a reason so they shouldn't be lost :) Enjoy!
