While briefly living in Raleigh, North Carolina, my husband and I had a few fantastic bread puddings. I know bread pudding isn't up
everyone's alley - but it is DEFINITELY up our alley. While having brunch at a <a href="https://www.lafarmbakery.com/">french bistro</a> we 
had an amazing blue crab bread pudding. Unfortunately, they change their menu frequently and I never saw it again. Le sigh. 
The other one that resonated with us was a good ol' southern bourbon bread pudding from a local microbrew in Durham near the UNC campus. 
We've dreamt about both since, but I have only recreated the latter. Here we go!

So I didn't take step by step photos this time because it was the first time making it and I didn't realize I was starting a blog.
It was dabomb.com and I plan on making it for an upcoming summer social I'm having for some colleagues and friends.
