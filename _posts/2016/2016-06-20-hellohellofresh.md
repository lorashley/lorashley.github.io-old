HELLLLLOOOOO! I am so excited to write about our first experience with [Hello Fresh](www.hellofresh.com/raf-helloshare/?c=ZBGZY3)! 

Today my box arrived and I was extremely impressed!

The menus were gorgeous and in a book-like form. They are also printed on thinner paper (still sturdy) compared to Blue Apron. Since 
I end up folding my recipe cards, this makes them less thick in general. I'd love if a service would have a notecard form
of these though! 

Another great thing is that [Hello Fresh](www.hellofresh.com/raf-helloshare/?c=ZBGZY3) individually boxed each meal. Unlike blue apron where you sort them yourself. Not a big
deal, but it made sticking it in the fridge a cinch and getting everything out, so simple. No need to consult the recipe cards
when sorting for ingredients

The packaging was nearly flawless. I saw the ice packs really dented the meats, but upon inspection - no harm. Good enough for me.

Overall, there seemed to be some use of plastic, but much less than Blue Apron. So far, the sauces even come in cute tiny glass
containers!  The produce of Blue Apron definitely looked more perfect but honestly I think so far the freshness is the same.
I'll be a better judge after more meals. Blue Apron is killin' it with the good quality products though in my book so far.

Prep was easy and I got to utilize my new counter compost bin. We just got a tumbler for outside since I am tired of putting our
scraps to trash!

As usual, these subscriptions make dinner making a breeze. My husband and I are truly enjoy the time not spent at the groceries
and the food we are not wasting at home!

*Enjoy!*
